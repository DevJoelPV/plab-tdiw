# Fake e-commerce

This project is a university assignment for the TDIW course (Internet and Web Development Technologies) at Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona. It consists of a full-stack web simulation of an e-commerce site. On this website, you can view products in each category, add them to your cart, and place an order, just like on a functional e-commerce site (however, no real payments are processed). Additionally, we implemented a user registration and login system, order registration, and order history.

This fake e-commerce site could be of any type of store. In my case, I decided to use TwoJeys products (https://twojeys.com/) as all product images were sourced from their website.

The objective of this project was to apply all the technologies taught in the course:
- JavaScript
- jQuery
- PHP
- HTML
- CSS
- SQL
Note: The project follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, as required by the course.

## Installation

To run this project, you'll need to use Xampp, because it has incorporated phpMyAdmin. You will need to import the databse, and move the project directory to the xampp's folder.

Note: the pictures URL's are not the relative ones, so it is necessary to change them, also in the databse.

## Usage
Once the website is running, you can browse products, add them to your cart, and place orders. You can also create a user account and login to view your order history.

## Credits
This project was created by me as an assignment for the TDIW course at Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona. All product images were sourced from TwoJeys (https://twojeys.com/).
